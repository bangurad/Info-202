       <br> visted Sierra Leone in 2021, It was me and my mother, we got to vist her home village, known as Maraka. 
       <br> Now back to me, I own 5 Dogs, 4 american bullies, two girls, Storm and Ciaga, and two boys, Saints and Kaine 
       <br> (Kaine is actually a stafordshire) and a French Bulldog, his name is Mars. I Graduated from Potomac Senior Highschool in 2023
       <br> I chose VCU Because I believe my major is very specific for how I want to stye my life. Last summer

       <br> playing 2k24 My go to team is the Caveliers or the Hornets. I am also really positive, I see the bright side of
       <br> everything that happens in life, whether is life threatning or not, I believe everything happens for a reason,
       <br> and thats about me.
